        .c-typography__paragraph
          The Financial Women’s Association of Singapore is a champion of gender diversity & inclusion (D&I) in the workplace. We engage individuals and organisations to recognize the contribution women have been making to the economy, the multiple hats women wear as care-givers and workers, and the importance of unbiased, fair and flexible work practices that support the advancement of women in their careers.
        .c-typography__paragraph
          As part of our journey of promoting D&I, the objective of FWA’s Female Champions’ initiative is to engage women: women who have walked the path to career success, are role models for younger, aspiring women and can share their learning journeys with other women.
        .c-typography__paragraph
          FWA’s Female Champions was initiated after our successful Male Champions initiative in March 2015 and was launched in November 2019. Our Female Champions are women in senior leadership positions who champion and support women seeking success on both the professional and personal fronts, can effect change in their organisations and be firm supporters of gender D&I in their workplaces and society at large.
